# GarlicSignage

Digital signage without vendor lock-in, monthly fees, or proprietary black boxes.  
A complete open-source stack, compatible to the [SMIL](https://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL3/) standard.

## The Stack

| Project | What it does | Platform |
|---|---|---|
| [garlic-player](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-player) | SMIL media player | Linux, Android, macOS, Windows |
| [garlic-hub](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-hub) | CMS & Device Management | Self-hosted |
| [garlic-launcher](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-launcher) | Root-free Android kiosk launcher | Android |
| [garlic-daemon](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-daemon) | systemd-based player maintenance (in development) | Linux |
| [garlic-proxy](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-proxy) | Proxy for restricted network environments | Self-hosted |

## Why SMIL?

SMIL is a W3C standard from 1998 that the industry quietly adopted and then buried under 
proprietary layers. It works. It's vendor-neutral. We think it deserves better tooling.
